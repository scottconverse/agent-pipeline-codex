"""Policy: source files in the project must not contain TODO/FIXME/HACK markers.

Treats unfinished work-in-progress markers as a Blocker for release tagging
— they accumulate across rungs and the "later" usually doesn't happen.
Audit findings get queued in `next-cleanup.md` instead.

This check enforces the rule for the project's source directory only.
`tests/` and `docs/` are explicitly excluded — tests legitimately mark
expected TODO regression cases (xfail rationale strings) and docs reference
the markers descriptively.

Configure SCAN_ROOTS for your project. Defaults to scanning every directory
under the repo root that contains Python files, excluding tests/, docs/,
.agent-runs/, .pipelines/, scripts/, and common venv / build / cache dirs.

    script is running from.

    Two supported layouts:

      * **Plugin source** — ``<repo>/scripts/check_no_todos.py``.
        The repo root is the immediate parent of the ``scripts/`` dir.

      * **Installed project** — ``<repo>/scripts/policy/check_no_todos.py``.
        After ``/pipeline-init`` copies the script under
        ``scripts/policy/``, the repo root is two directories up.

    Detection is by the script's parent directory name. If the parent
    is ``policy`` and the grandparent is ``scripts``, we're in the
    installed layout; otherwise we're in the plugin source layout (or
    a non-standard placement, in which case the immediate parent of
    ``scripts/`` is the best available guess).

    The original implementation hard-coded ``parents[2]`` for the
    installed layout, which caused the plugin source layout to scan
    the plugin's *parent* directory (e.g. ``Desktop/Codex/`` when
    cloned into ``Desktop/Codex/agent-pipeline-codex``), pulling sibling
    projects into the scan and emitting spurious failures.
