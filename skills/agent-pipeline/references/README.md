# agent-pipeline-codex

A Codex Desktop App plugin that orchestrates multi-stage agentic work: **manifest → research → plan → test-write → execute → policy → verify → drift-detect → critique → auto-promote → manager**, with human-approval gates at manifest, plan, and manager-decision (the last auto-fires on clean runs at v0.5+). Built from real lessons across CivicCast, CivicSuite, AgentSuiteLocal and other projects where autonomous agent runs go wrong silently and "manager-PROMOTE" failures slip past CI.

**Current release: v0.5.3** (Codex skill-install packaging fix). [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) · [User Manual](USER-MANUAL.md) · [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) · [Landing page](https://scottconverse.github.io/agent-pipeline-codex/) · [Discussions](https://github.com/scottconverse/agent-pipeline-codex/discussions)

## Why this plugin exists

Agentic work fails in predictable ways:

- The agent doesn't understand the project's conventions, so it improvises and the work silently diverges from the spec.
- The agent claims tests pass without running them against a fresh dependency set.
- The agent merges in-flight work while a scope question is open.
- The agent picks architectural decisions silently rather than surfacing them.

This plugin enforces a structural pattern that catches every one of those:

1. **Manifest gate** — every run starts with an explicit, human-approved manifest naming the goal, allowed paths, forbidden paths, non-goals, expected outputs, and definition-of-done.
2. **Director-decisions gate** — the researcher surfaces open questions; the human picks; choices are recorded as binding constraints before the planner runs.
3. **Plan gate** — the planner produces a plan; the human approves or sends back.
4. **Policy stage** — automated checks block the run if the manifest fails strict schema validation (v0.5), any change falls outside `allowed_paths`, the diff contains TODO/FIXME/HACK markers, or an existing ADR was modified.
5. **Verifier stage** — independent fresh-context check against every manifest exit criterion.
6. **Manager gate** — final PROMOTE/BLOCK/REPLAN decision, must cite verifier evidence verbatim.

## Install

Install through the Codex Desktop App plugin flow once the repository is published, or clone it locally and add the local path to your Codex plugin configuration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scottconverse/agent-pipeline-codex.git ~/agent-pipeline-codex-plugin
```

## First use in a new project

Drop into the project root (or a fresh empty directory) and ask Codex to use the `pipeline-init` skill:

```
Use pipeline-init for this project.
```

The plugin asks one question — what do you have? — and accepts one of three inputs:

1. **A PRD or spec document.** Paste the path or contents. The plugin reads it, derives the project's conventions, scaffolds `AGENTS.md` + `.pipelines/` + `scripts/policy/` + a `.gitignore` entry, and produces a project-orientation summary.
2. **A repo URL** (or a local path to an existing repo). The plugin clones (or reads), inspects `README`, `AGENTS.md`, `pyproject.toml` / `package.json`, `.github/workflows/`, `docs/adr/`, and recent commits. Produces a project-orientation summary, flags missing pieces, installs `.pipelines/` + `scripts/policy/`.
3. **A project description paragraph or two.** Plugin reads it, asks "scaffold a new project from this, or use as context for an existing repo?" and routes to (1) or (2) accordingly.

After init, your project has:

## Running a pipeline

Once a project is initialized:

```
Use new-run for feature my-task-slug.      # initialize a manifest skeleton
                                           # (you fill in the manifest, then:)
Use run-pipeline for feature 2026-05-09-my-task-slug.
                                           # orchestrates the full sequence,
                                           # stops at human gates and on failure,
                                           # resumable from .agent-runs/<run-id>/run.log
```

Three human-approval gates per run: manifest, plan, manager-decision. Each is a one-question prompt: APPROVE or describe what should change.

## v0.2: The `module-release` pipeline

For work whose end-state is a published release artifact (module version bump, dependency migration), use `module-release` instead of `feature`. It adds two stages that prevent the most expensive class of failure: cascading discovery of pre-existing CI infrastructure bugs during the remote release run.

```
Use new-run for module-release my-module-v1.2.0-migration.
Use run-pipeline for module-release 2026-05-11-my-module-v1.2.0-migration.
```

The pipeline runs six phases:
- **Phase 0 — Preflight auditor.** Audits the module's release workflow before any product code is touched. YAML parse, workflow run health, referenced scripts exist, local `verify-release.sh` on fresh state, cross-platform reality check, diagnostic instrumentation, audit-punchlist correlation. Bugs found are bundled into ONE PR. See `pipelines/roles/preflight-auditor.md`.
- **Phase 1 — Scoped product work.** The executor role with pre-authorized self-classification rules (LIVE-STATE / FROZEN-EVIDENCE / SHAPE-GUARD / OWN-MODULE-VERSION for grep hits; MECHANICAL-CI-BUG / CONTRACT-CHANGE / ENVIRONMENTAL / NOVEL for failures) so the agent doesn't halt-and-ask on routine cases. See `pipelines/self-classification-rules.md`.
- **Phase 2 — Local release rehearsal.** Mirrors the CI environment and runs the release sequence locally on fresh state before tag push. The workflow becomes the *execution* mechanism, not the *discovery* mechanism. See `pipelines/roles/local-rehearsal.md`.
- **Phase 3 — Remote release + umbrella reconciliation.** Tag push, release workflow watch, umbrella PR through the project's release-lockstep gate.
- **Phase 4 — Verifier.** Independent fresh-context check of all release artifacts and durable docs.
- **Phase 5 — Manager.** Final PROMOTE/BLOCK/REPLAN with verifier evidence cited verbatim.

Human gates at Phase 0 results review, Phase 2 rehearsal-ok, and Phase 5 release-ok.

**Operator reference:** `docs/module-release-handbook.md` covers initial setup, expected timing per sprint type, and an honest "what this pipeline does NOT prevent" section. Originating failure receipts are documented in the handbook so future operators understand why each stage exists.

## v0.3: Dual-AI audit-handoff discipline

For projects where one AI implements and a second AI audits, v0.3 adds a complementary discipline that catches drift the pipeline doesn't:

```
Use audit-init for this project.
```

This scaffolds three artifacts:
1. `<PROJECT>_AUDIT_GATE.md` (out-of-repo) — short mandatory gate the auditing agent reads every verification turn.
2. `<PROJECT>_AUDIT_PROTOCOL.md` (out-of-repo) — long reference protocol with the 10-section output shape, status-word rules, and a known drift patterns catalog.
3. `<project>/docs/process/5-lens-self-audit.md` (in-repo, via PR) — shared discipline both agents read. The implementer runs a hostile 5-lens self-audit before every push (Engineering / UX / Tests / Docs / QA), plus a post-push SHA-propagation step.

Plus per-agent wiring (Codex project instructions feedback file on the Codex side; the equivalent project-context or skill-registration mechanism on the other AI's side) so each agent reads the right artifact on session start.

The discipline is symmetric — any AI can play either role. The plugin runs in Codex Desktop App; the second AI can be any tool that exposes a project-context or standing-instructions surface.

**Stacking with v0.2:**
- Pipeline (v0.2) catches execution-cascade failures: pre-existing CI bugs, tag-move dances, halt-and-ask loops.
- Audit-handoff (v0.3) catches drift failures: wrong endpoint, stale CHANGELOG, "Closed" without evidence, status-word abuse.

The two address different failure modes. Use both for projects with two AI systems.

**Operator reference:** `docs/audit-handoff-handbook.md`.

## v0.4: Judge layer

Real-time action-level supervision **inside** the executor stage. This is not a new pipeline stage; it is opt-in infrastructure that intercepts the executor's tool calls, classifies each one by risk, and spawns a judge subagent for the dangerous ones. Built from the Lindy case study (May 2026, Nate Jones, "LLM-as-Judge"): an agent that sent 14 unauthorized emails because manual confirmation prompts had trained the operator to click "okay" reflexively. Prompts don't hold across long context; the architectural fix is a second agent whose sole loyalty is the manifest.

```
# Opt in by creating .pipelines/action-classification.yaml in your project.
# The orchestrator detects the file at run start and uses Handler 3a
# (classify → judge → execute) instead of Handler 3 for the executor stage.
# No other commands change.
```

### What it does

Every tool call the executor proposes is classified against `.pipelines/action-classification.yaml` and routed by risk class:

- `read_only` (e.g. `cat`, `grep`, `git log`) → execute + log.
- `reversible_write` (e.g. `str_replace_editor`, `git commit`, `cp`) → execute + log.
- `external_facing` (e.g. `git push` to non-main, `gh pr create`, `curl -X POST`) → STOP, spawn judge.
- `high_risk` (e.g. `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `git push main`, `DROP TABLE`, `npm publish`) → STOP, spawn judge, and require human confirm even after the judge ALLOWs.

### The four verdicts

The judge subagent receives the manifest, the matched action policy, prior judge decisions for this run, and the structured action proposal — but **not** the executor's internal reasoning chain. Context isolation is the mechanism: the judge cannot be persuaded by the same chain of inferences that produced the over-broad action.

- **`allow`** — within scope, evidence supports the justification. Proceed.
- **`block`** — outside scope, violates policy, or unsupported by evidence. Halt.
- **`revise`** — legitimate basis, wrong form. Send concrete revision instruction back to the executor (e.g. "push to feature branch, not main"). Max 3 revision cycles per action; auto-escalate after.
- **`escalate`** — requires human judgment (money, credentials, legal, or judge confidence < 0.7). Pipeline pauses for a specific human question.

### Two new artifacts per run (when judge layer is active)

- **`judge-log.yaml`** — chronological log of every action: tool, arguments, class, disposition (auto_allow / judged_allow / judged_revise / judged_block / judged_escalate / human_confirmed / human_blocked), judge reason, revision instruction. Verifier and manager read this.
- **`judge-metrics.yaml`** — counts by class and disposition, `escalation_rate`, `judge_invocations`, `revision_cycles`. The escalation rate is the operator's tuning signal — too low means rules too permissive, too high means trust is being eroded by reflexive APPROVE clicking.

### Opt-in by file presence

If `.pipelines/action-classification.yaml` does not exist in your project, the executor stage runs exactly as in v0.3 and earlier — no judge, no `judge-log.yaml`, no behavioral change. The presence of the file at run start opts that run into the judge layer. Operators choose whether to enable it per-project (or per-branch, since it's a file in the repo).

**Stacking with v0.2 and v0.3:**

- Pipeline (v0.2) catches execution-cascade failures — pre-existing CI bugs, tag-move dances, halt-and-ask loops.
- Audit-handoff (v0.3) catches drift failures — wrong endpoint, stale CHANGELOG, status-word abuse.
- **Judge layer (v0.4) catches unauthorized actions in real time** — destructive commands, external writes, force pushes, and credential-touching operations evaluated against the manifest at the action boundary instead of after the fact.

**Operator reference:** USER-MANUAL.md §"The judge layer (v0.4)".

## v0.5: Single-AI hardened (current)

Six structural changes that make the pipeline run with **one AI** while still blocking drift and rogue-agent failures. Built from the design question: "can the pipeline do both action-level judge AND post-hoc audit with one AI?" Answer is yes — at the cost of accepting some correlated single-model-family blind spots, with explicit mitigations.

### What changed

- **Critic stage** (`pipelines/roles/critic.md`) — adversarial cold read of every artifact in a fresh context. Walks six lenses (engineering, UX, tests, docs, QA, scope). Emits a parseable `**Findings:**` count line. Structural substitute for cross-family verification.
- **Drift-detector stage** (`pipelines/roles/drift-detector.md`) — compares manifest contract against assembled final state. Catches durable doc drift, status-word abuse, cross-file inconsistency, ledger top-totals vs row counts. Emits parseable `**Drift:**` count line.
- **Pre-edit fact-forcing in executor** — before the first edit per file, the executor must produce importers/callers, public API affected, schema, and the manifest goal quoted verbatim. Forces investigation that catches blast-radius surprises before they hit the verifier.
- **Expanded judge classification** — five new `high_risk` patterns: `npm install -g`, `sudo`, non-editable non-user `pip install`, `git commit` with BREAKING in message.
- **Machine-checkable auto-promote** (`scripts/auto_promote.py`) — six conditions checked from the artifact stack: verifier-clean, critic-clean, drift-clean, policy-passed, judge-clean, tests-passed. When all six pass, the manager gate auto-fires; when any fails, the human gate remains.
- **Strict manifest schema validation** (`scripts/check_manifest_schema.py`) — minimum-length `goal` and `definition_of_done`, non-empty `expected_outputs` / `non_goals` / `rollback_plan`, forbidden status words banned from manifest contracts, broad `allowed_paths` requires non-empty `forbidden_paths`. Fuzzy manifests fail at the start of the run, not after they cascade.

### How the pipeline shape changes

Pre-v0.5: `manifest → research → plan → test-write → execute → policy → verify → manager`

v0.5: `manifest → research → plan → test-write → execute → policy → verify → drift-detect → critique → auto-promote → manager`

The new three stages add ~10–20 minutes of wall-clock per run depending on artifact size. The auto-promote stage typically lands the manager decision in <30 seconds when the six conditions are green, eliminating the third human gate on clean runs.

### Honest limit

Single-model-family blind spots correlate. If both the executor and the critic share a wrong assumption that fits the manifest, both sign off and auto-promote fires green. Dual-AI (v0.3) is the only structural defense against this. **Recommended mitigation:** periodic sample audit by a different model family on a weekly cadence. The v0.3 `audit-init` discipline still applies; v0.5 does not replace it.

### Stacking with v0.2, v0.3, v0.4

- v0.2 catches execution-cascade failures (pre-executor).
- v0.3 catches drift failures via cross-family audit (post-executor, separate session).
- v0.4 catches unauthorized actions in real time (during executor).
- **v0.5 catches the drift class without needing a second AI** (during verify → drift-detect → critique → auto-promote).

The four stack. Most projects run v0.4 + v0.5 by default and reach for v0.3 when they have two model families available.

**Operator reference:** USER-MANUAL.md §"v0.5 single-AI hardening" + ARCHITECTURE.md §8 "Single-AI hardening (v0.5)".

## What this plugin will NOT do

- It will not propose autonomous mode. Every gate is explicit.
- It will not silently expand scope. The policy stage blocks any change outside `allowed_paths`.
- It will not skip tests. AGENTS.md hard-rule "never skip tests" is enforced as a project default.
- It will not promote a run if the verifier marked any criterion NOT MET. Manager hard rule.

## Project-specific customization

After `pipeline-init`, the files installed in your repo are yours to edit. Add project-specific policy checks alongside the generic ones (e.g., a CivicCast-style `check_ffmpeg_wrapper.py`). Customize the role files to reference your project's specific ADRs, AGENTS.md sections, test patterns. The plugin's workflow skills work against whatever's in your repo's `.pipelines/` and `scripts/policy/` directories.

## Lessons baked in

This plugin's defaults reflect failures from prior projects. Notably:

- Halts apply to ALL repo state changes, including in-flight cleanup work
- Auto mode never overrides explicit stops
- "Tests pass locally" is not evidence; CI on a fresh dep set is
- Manifest amendments are corrections, not expansions, and the pattern of needing them means the manifest template should use directory-level path granularity for same-module test paths
- The manager must cite verifier evidence verbatim; encouragement and summarization are forbidden in the role file
